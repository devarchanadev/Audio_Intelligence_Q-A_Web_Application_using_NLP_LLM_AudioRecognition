## Project Overview
I developed an innovative **Audio Intelligence** product that converts speech into text using **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)**, processes and extracts insights using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, and leverages transformer-based **Large Language Models (LLMs)** for interactive Question Answering (QA).  
  
The system takes spoken language from audio files (such as meetings, interviews, or customer calls), converts it into text, and then provides a concise summary along with the ability to ask targeted questions‚Äîyielding actionable insights for decision-making. Finally, I hosted it as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## Implementation & Technical Approach
### Audio Processing & ASR üó£Ô∏è
- **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:**  
  I use [Librosa](https://librosa.org) and [Pydub](https://github.com/jiaaro/pydub) to load and convert audio files into WAV format, then split them into segments based on silence.
- **Transcription:**  
  The [SpeechRecognition](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) library converts these segments into text, resulting in a complete transcript.

### NLP & Summarization üìö
- **Text Processing:**  
  I employ [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org) and [TextBlob](https://textblob.readthedocs.io/) for tokenization, sentence segmentation, and extracting key noun phrases.
- **Summarization:**  
  A transformer-based summarization model from Hugging Face (using `sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6`) generates concise summaries of the transcript.

### Question Answering with LLMs üí°
- **Interactive QA:**  
  For Q&A, I use a pre-trained transformer-based model, **deepset/roberta-base-squad2**, from Hugging Face. This LLM delivers precise, context-aware answers by selecting the most relevant text segments.
- **Optimization:**  
  GPU acceleration and smart context selection optimize performance, ensuring real-time response.

### Hosting as a Web Application üåê
- **User Interface:**  
  I built an attractive, dark-themed interface with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io) that features a sidebar (with chat history and control buttons) and a main panel for file uploads and Q&A.
- **External Access:**  
  Using [Pyngrok](https://pypi.org/project/pyngrok/), I expose the app via a public URL for easy remote access.
